00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,300
Excuse me?

2
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,999
Excuse me, sir? 

3
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,500
Excuse me?

4
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Oh, come on.

5
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Do you have a moment, sir?

6
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,049
I'm kind of in the middle of something here. 
Yes? Thank you.

7
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,949
I've come a long way for you, Franck.

8
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
My name is Victor.

9
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Hi.

10
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And you are....

11
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,500
You are Franck.

12
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,1000
You are so much more than just a sheep, aren't you?

13
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Oh yeah? How would you know?

14
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,899
Look at you. You're an adventurer, Franck.

15
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,999
Just like me, you're... a lone wolf.

16
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Tell me, does one choose to be alone?

17
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No, one doesn't.

18
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,600
One doesn’t even choose to be a wolf.

19
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Or does one?

20
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,799
Well, mister... err... Hector. 

21
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,999
Victor. Victor.

22
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don’t know what you’re on about but I'm just 
a sheep minding its own business.

23
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,599
And I suggest you do the same.

24
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,998
No. No no no, Franck. Wait wait wait. 

25
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No. This is not... the way.

26
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,500
Just give me one minute of your precious time.

27
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,500
Precious time? Hehehe.

28
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,500
Yeah just give me one minute.

29
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,500
You would have one more minute, wouldn't you?

30
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay half. Half a minute.

31
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,300
I knew it.
I knew it.

32
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,1000
You will not regret this.

33
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The adventures you will have. 

34
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,500
All the lives you've ever wanted.

35
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,699
All you’ve been missing.

36
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,998
Here. This is... the best product we have... in store.

37
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Variable spin speed, excellent tumble performance...

38
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
...in one... handy... device. Squeaky clean.

39
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Well this... this better be good. 

40
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Took me ages to tie that rope.

41
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
With my fucking hooves.

42
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
No more need for hooves.

43
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
No more sheepy business.

44
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,500
Ho! Time flies.

45
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,699
Wait wait wait wait wait wait.

46
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:18,499
How does this thing work? 

47
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,1000
I mean, how do I make it work?

48
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,500
No you don't.

49
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,1000
I just turned it on for you.

50
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
When can I go? 

51
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Where can I go?

52
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
We will pick you up. Don't worry, just stay here.

53
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
In this exact place.

54
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Don't move. Just wait.

55
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's it?

56
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Hey!

57
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,1000
Hey!

58
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,500
Wait, mister!

59
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,899
Eh, Casper!

60
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:50,999
Hector whatever!
