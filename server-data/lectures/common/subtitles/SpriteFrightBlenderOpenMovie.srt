00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:19,457
Hello, Mr.Snail!

2
00:00:19,457 --> 00:00:22,332
Aw, you cute little cornu aspersum.

3
00:00:22,332 --> 00:00:25,123
Latin name bonus-points!

4
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,832
Can’t believe we got stuck with the tree hugger.

5
00:00:30,832 --> 00:00:34,666
If I have to hear the latin name for one more animal, I swear I'm gonna kill her.

6
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:39,542
Relax, Sugar Buns. While she does all the work we’ll have all the fun.

7
00:00:39,542 --> 00:00:42,582
Yeah! And get wasted out of our minds!

8
00:00:42,582 --> 00:00:44,249
Way ahead of you, man.

9
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,625
C’mon, team! We mustn’t dilly-dally when there’s so much nature to see!

10
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:53,666
I was thinking we should call our class project, “Fungis in a Forest!”

11
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:56,167
Get it? Because we’re a group of fun guys.

12
00:00:56,167 --> 00:00:57,667
And also fungis which-

13
00:00:57,667 --> 00:01:02,458
Shush! That’s a yellow wagtail. And she’s in distress!

14
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,333
There, there, my little motacilla flava.

15
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:10,042
Oh! Look at her go!

16
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:11,500
Wow!

17
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,416
Out of the way, dorkwad! We're camping here.

18
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:17,500
Finally! Time to get that BBQ burning.

19
00:01:18,417 --> 00:01:20,167
Oh. Oh, dear.

20
00:01:27,332 --> 00:01:28,874
Gross!

21
00:01:30,832 --> 00:01:35,457
Oh. Easy, guys. We’re supposed to be studying nature, not wrecking it.

22
00:01:35,457 --> 00:01:37,957
Piss break!

23
00:01:40,707 --> 00:01:44,666
Oy, fungus freak! Make yourself useful and fix the tent.

24
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:48,917
Oh, a bit of friendly campsite ribbing. Fun.

25
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,582
She wouldn't survive 5 minutes alone in these woods.

26
00:01:52,582 --> 00:01:56,790
Yeah. She's a real weenie that one, innit?

27
00:01:56,792 --> 00:01:58,1000
Oy, Phil! How those sausages coming?

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,458
Almost ready! Just need a bit more salt...

29
00:02:36,332 --> 00:02:39,207
It's incredible. It's a new species.

30
00:02:39,207 --> 00:02:41,873
What the bloody hell are those things?

31
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,541
It's like a gnome shagged a mushroom.

32
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,582
They’re absolutely adorable.

33
00:02:59,582 --> 00:03:01,998
Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,625
And I bet we’ll make a fortune if we catch one of those things.

35
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:06,957
We'd be famous!

36
00:03:06,957 --> 00:03:08,291
Get on MTV.

37
00:03:08,292 --> 00:03:09,875
I wonder what they taste like.

38
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,500
We really shouldn't disrupt their habitat.

39
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,916
Right. Sure, sure.

40
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:17,500
Greetings.

41
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,1000
Welcome, friends.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,208
I'll be right down.

43
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,750
Could I interest you in some peppermint tea?

44
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,667
What are you guys?

45
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:34,417
We are Sprites. We sprite balance to the forest.

46
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:39,667
We take care of the animals, plants, birds, moss...

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,916
Guys? Guys, I...

48
00:03:46,582 --> 00:03:51,540
Hey, uh, little mushroom geezer, you cool with us camping here for the night?

49
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:56,333
Absolutely. A friend of the forest is a friend of the sprites.

50
00:03:57,707 --> 00:04:01,373
Maybe it was just ketchup... or something... like...

51
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:09,125
Red paint? Yeah, maybe they were just painting their little hats or... something...

52
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,042
Guys?

53
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,625
Guys?

54
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,956
Guys, this isn't funny.

55
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,625
Guys?

56
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:50,166
We were just gonna catch one! But they’re psycho!

57
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,956
You gotta get me outta these! Hurry! They’re gonna kill us!

58
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:56,582
Hurry!

59
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,458
Right foot, left foot, leaf and stone.

60
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:03,583
You picked the wrong camping spot, bitches.

61
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,292
Sprite them!

62
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,542
Run!!!

63
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,091
Take that, you little freaks!

64
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:22,286
Sprite this! 

65
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,083
Aaaah! My eyes!

66
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,625
Sugar Buns?! Help me!

67
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,875
Sweet cakes!

68
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,206
Love muffin...

69
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,666
Huh?

70
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:43,456
No, no, no! I can’t swim!

71
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,875
Yes!

72
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,706
No!

73
00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:08,140
Son of a Spriteberry!

74
00:07:08,141 --> 00:07:09,608
It burns! It burns! 

75
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:16,208
I don’t want to hurt you! Just keep your distance!

76
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:21,124
All right, then. Eat salt, you little green bastards!

77
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,541
Nuh-uh-uh.

78
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:03,332
Those punks treated the world as their own personal rubbish bin.

79
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,624
And you set them free!

80
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,833
Now you'll join them!

81
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:49,166
I’ll give you that one, Brother Bird!

82
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,416
Alright sprites, let’s burn the bodies and have some peppermint tea.
